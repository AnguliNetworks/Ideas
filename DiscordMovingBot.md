# Discord Moving Bot
----
Often a message on discord is in the wrong channel. A solution to this would be a bot, that simply moves all messages that are not belonging to this channel to the right channel via a command executed by staff or trusted members.
An Example for the command could be:
```
!move <channel> <number-of-messages>
!move #java 10 // Moves the last 10 messages to #java
```
The messages should be posted in the new channel as embeds for example. Also they should be deleted in the old channel.
