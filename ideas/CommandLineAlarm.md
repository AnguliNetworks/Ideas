# Command Line Alarm
----
Quickly start a timer. Or set an alarm. Or just stop the time. But not with a big desktop/web app with heavy animations etc. Just a simple and clean command to:
* see the current time
* set a timer
* set an alarm
* stop the time

It should be functional and good looking, but do not overdress it. Just simple and clean.
